Music-Generation is a deep learning project that uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, to generate music based on training data from MIDI files 

## Author - Shashank Pandey   


## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Trains on MIDI files to learn musical patterns
- Uses LSTM-based neural network for sequence prediction
- Outputs new, AI-generated music in MIDI format
- Handles data preprocessing, model training, and generation

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Music21 (for MIDI parsing)
- NumPy
- Pickle
